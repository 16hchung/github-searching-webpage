# Heejung Chung, Way2B1 coding exercise 2017

## Problem
Create a page that finds and displays GitHub users' basic information.
Be able to display profile avatars and a list of repo names.

## My solution
Go to: https://sleepy-reef-62491.herokuapp.com
Most of my implementation is in the file: views/pages/index.ejs

## Resources I used
This repo is a clone of Heroku's starter template. I followed their tutorial found at this link: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction
